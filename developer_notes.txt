Current build:

In its current state, Linux Universal Software Installer has no main method.
Only unique scripts are being written and optomized. Any installation script
for any software or software extension will be considered for integration.

TODO:

[1]	add main installation script (a C program is not needed seeing that gcc may not be installed)

[2]	case: javadev_pack/eclipse.installer.sh
		- needs a dynamic approach to reading the xml on oracle's 
		website so that downloads are not dependent on hard-coded urls
		
[3]	case: vivaldi_pack
		- source code is incomplete
